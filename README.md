## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving domotics and energy efficiency at home.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop and code my own DIY devices for home automations using ESPHome.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about home automation and photovoltaics monitoring.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: willing to learn Git workflow and coding to understand my development team at work, so used my personal motivation to improve home domotics as trigger and learning path.
